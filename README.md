# health-data
An analysis of cardiovascular disease using Python data visualization libraries (Pandas, Matplotlib). I've always been interested in the correlation between common health datapoints such as BMI or cholestrol and the prevelance of cardiovascular disease. With a public, crowdsourced dataset (provided on repo), I analyzed this correlation using data visualizations. I first calculated BMI for each offered datapoint in an effort to establish correlation between higher BMI and the frequency of cardiovascular disease on a scatterplot. The results were ambigious so I plotted a line of best fit as well. I then wanted to expand my analysis of correlation to cover all datapoints (not just BMI and cardiovascular disease), and thus created a correlation table. Finally, I designed a stacked histogram to delve into the relationship between fitness (activity level) and high cholestrol.
